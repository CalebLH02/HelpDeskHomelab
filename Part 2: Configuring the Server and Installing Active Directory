For the second part of the homelab setup, I completed the following tasks:

- Renamed the server for easier future use.
- Installed Active Directory Domain Services.

Renaming the Server:
This step was straightforward. I opened File Explorer, right-clicked on This PC, and selected Rename PC to give the server a more descriptive name.

Installing Active Directory:
Setting up Active Directory was slightly more involved. In Server Manager, I navigated to Manage â†’ Add Roles and Features, which opened the installation wizard.
On the Before You Begin and Installation Type pages, I clicked Next.

- On the Server Selection page, I confirmed the current server was selected.

- On the Server Roles page, I checked Active Directory Domain Services and continued through the prompts.

- Once the installation completed, I promoted the server to a domain controller.

- I created a new forest, specified a domain name, and set a Directory Services Restore Mode password.

- I continued through the wizard and allowed the server to reboot.

- After the reboot, I pinned Active Directory Users and Computers to the taskbar.

This completes Part 2 of my help desk homelab.
