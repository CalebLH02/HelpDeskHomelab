Before diving deeper into IT help desk info, it’s important to understand the basics of how computers actually work.

Binary and How It Works?

Computers don’t understand human language. They use binary, which is just 0s and 1s.
A 0 means “off”, or “false”, and that means no electrical signal. 1 means “on”, or “true”, and that a signal is present.
Everything a computer does, such as text, images, music, and programs, is ultimately represented in binary. 
For a very simple example, the number 5 in binary is 101. 

Bits and Bytes?

A bit is the smallest piece of data in a computer. It can only be 0 or 1.
A byte is 8 bits. For example, 01010101.
Bytes are used to store small amounts of data.
Common units are kilobyte, or KB,which 1,024 bytes. megabyte, or MB, which is 1,024 KB, and finally gigabyte, or GB, which is 1,024 MB.
