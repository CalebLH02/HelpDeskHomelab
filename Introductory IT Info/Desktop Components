ESD Precautions & Opening Computers
Electrostatic Discharge is static electricity that can damage computer parts, and also harm you. 
Always ground yourself before touching components, such as using an anti-static wrist strap or touching metal. 
And, when opening a PC, always unplug it from power first!

CPU (Central Processing Unit)
The “brain” of the computer. It executes instructions, does calculations, and manages data flow. 
Modern CPUs typically have multiple cores to handle tasks in parallel, which in turn makes a faster PC. 
With the CPU working so much, it uses a heatsink and fan, or liquid cooling, to prevent overheating.
