ESD Precautions & Opening Computers
Electrostatic Discharge is static electricity that can damage computer parts, and also harm you. 
Always ground yourself before touching components, such as using an anti-static wrist strap or touching metal. 
And, when opening a PC, always unplug it from power first!
